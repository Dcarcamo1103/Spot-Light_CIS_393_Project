Spot-Light Website - CIS 393 Project
Spot-Light is a website that helps you keep a log full with the movies and shows you've watched or plan on watching. You can add movies to the list in the "My Media" page, said movies that you add will be automatically loaded to an external MySQL database.

HOW IT WORKS:
1. Go to the "My Media" page (either by clicking on "Add a movie" on the home page or clicking the "Watched" option in the nav bar).
2. Click the "Add +" button in the top right.
3. Insert a movie name. As you type words, it'll render a suggested movies box so you can click on the movie you are looking for.
4. Select wether you've seen the movie or you plan on to.
5. Enter a score you want to give the movie (the default value for movies is 1).
6. Click the "Add movie" button.

A table with the fields of Genre, Name, Year, Type, Status, and Actions, which has the options to edit and delete in it, is rendered in the page. The edit button lets the user edit the status and score, all changes made in through the front end will automatically update the MySQL database. As well as if you delete a movie from the website's table.
