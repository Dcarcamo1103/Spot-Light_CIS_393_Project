Spot-Light Website - CIS 393 Project #1
Spot-Light is a website that helps you keep a log full with the movies and shows you've watched or plan on watching. Since Project #1 is just the front-end of the website, features like storing your logged movies or organizing movies between the planned and the watched sections isn't fully implemented yet, that'll be for Project #2. You can, however, try to add movies to the list in the watched page just so get an idea of how it'll work once it's fully implemented.

HOW IT WORKS:
1. Go to the "Watched" page (either by clicking on "Add a movie" on the home page or clicking the "Watched" option in the nav bar).
2. Click the "Add +" button in the top right.
3. Insert a movie name. As you type words, it'll render a suggested movies box so you can click on the movie you are looking for.
4. Select a genre for the movie.
5. Select wether you've seen the movie or you plan on to.
6. Click the "Add movie" button.

A table with the fields of Genre, Name, Year, Type, Status, and Actions, which has the options to edit and delete in it, is rendered in the page. Currently you can delete, but not edit movies in the table, that'll be for Project #2.

Again, as of now this is just the front-end, plus some JS added for features.
